# world-border
Borders for all countries, extracted from OpenStreetMap, in GeoJSON &amp; ESRI Shapefile (shp).

## ⚠️Disclaimer

Just as OpenStreetMap, with regard to boundary conflicts, please note:

OSM/world-border follows On the Ground Rule. Boundaries recorded in OpenStreetMap/world-border are the ones that are the most widely internationally recognised and that best meet realities on the ground, generally meaning physical control. In areas without clearly defined borders, the line is approximate.

It does not mean that OSM community/world-border considers specific invasions/wars/whatever that resulted in border change as good/desirable/welcome/wrong. OSM community/world-border attempts to map world as it exists, not as it should exist.

In some cases borders may overlap without making it an incorrect tagging. It may be result of agreement between countries to administer area together or to mark areas not controlled by any country, with both claiming it. In some countries, subnational boundaries overlap in complex ways in reality, so data consumers and quality assurance tools should not assume that an administrative boundary is a subarea of only one administrative boundary.
